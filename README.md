# spotify searcher

Jupyter notebook exploring the idea of searching a given user's public spotify playlists for a song and returning the playlists it is contained in. This is a function missing from Spotify's UI and not apparently catered for by any plugins currently.

The idea of this came from my method of playlisting by month, resulting in now over 50 playlists which are all well under 50 songs. This makes songs easy to file in my memory, but when you have forgotten which month a song is in, it can be tedious to search for. Several people have asked on forums whether it is possible to check playlist membership for your own library, suggesting that it is not an uncomon problem to have.
